            <p class="nhsuk-body">This service is run by NHS England. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. This means you should be able to:</p>
            
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality</li>
                <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>some parts of the service have an illogical focus order with some screen readers</li>
                <li>when some pages load, screen readers may not move to the new content automatically</li>
                <li>with VoiceOver the page will focus on the main heading but not read it out</li>
                <li>NVDA and JAWS may not focus on the new content and start further down the page. If this happens, we recommend you navigate to the main heading on the page as the new content always starts with the Heading level 1</li>
                <li>some screen readers will not read out input fields</li>
                <li>dynamic content is not displayed to those using screen readers</li>
                <li>hint text is not properly associated with the input field</li>
                <li>error messages when adding a session date are not associated with the input field</li>
                <li>the focus of error messages should direct to the input field and not the continue button</li>
                <li>there is not an option to extend the timeout feature</li>
