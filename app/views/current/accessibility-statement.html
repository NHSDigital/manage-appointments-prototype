        <p data-block-key="po0nx">This accessibility statement applies to the Manage your appointments staff application
          in the National Booking Service (NBS).</p>
        </p>
        <p>This service is run by NHS England. We want as many people as possible to use this website. This means you
          should be able to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li data-block-key="don97">change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality</li>
          <li data-block-key="etvsi">zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li data-block-key="2bibc">navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
          <li data-block-key="9qsfs">navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
          <li data-block-key="9c8na">interact with most of the website using a screen reader (including recent versions
            of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>

        <h2>How accessible this website is</h2>


        <p data-block-key="po0nx">We know thats parts of this service are not fully accessible.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>some parts of the service have an illogical focus order with some screen readers.</li>
          <li>when some pages load, screen readers may not move to the new content automatically</li>
          <li>With VoiceOver the page will focus on the main heading but not read it out</li>
          <li>NVDA and JAWS may not focus on the new content and start further
            down the page. If this happens, we recommend you navigate to the main heading on the page, as the new
            content
            always starts with the Heading level 1.</li>

        </ul>

        <p data-block-key="48cd8">We are actively working to address these issues as well as improving the overall
          accessibility of this service.</p>
