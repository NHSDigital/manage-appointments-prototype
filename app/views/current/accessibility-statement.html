        <p data-block-key="po0nx">This accessibility statement applies to the Book a vaccination website.
        </p>
        <p data-block-key="4etd7">We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. This means you
          should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li data-block-key="don97">change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality</li>
          <li data-block-key="etvsi">zoom in up to 400 per cent without the text spilling off the screen</li>

        <h2>How accessible this website is</h2>









        <p data-block-key="po0nx">We know from several accessibility audits that parts of this website are not fully
          accessible.</p>
        <p data-block-key="9up3q">Some parts of the website have an illogical focus order with some screen readers. When
          some pages load, screen readers may not move to the new content automatically. With VoiceOver the page will
          focus the main heading but not read it out. NVDA and JAWS may not focus on the new content and start further
          down the page. If this happens, we recommend you navigate to the main heading on the page, the new content
          always starts with the heading level 1.</p>
        <p data-block-key="48cd8">We are actively working to address these issues as part of an ongoing programme to
          improve the accessibility of this website.</p>
